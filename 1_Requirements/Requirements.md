Introduction
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data.

Image steganography is hiding the text within an image without making a huge change within the image and hence making it unrecognisable to the eye.

Features:
Encoding the image with the text

Decoding the image to retrieve the text
